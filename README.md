# WineQuality_LR
Using linear regression model for predicting wine quality

For model constructing this data set was used: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

Linear model does not fit this dataset wery well, maybe polynomial regression will do better work
For detales see this paper on linked in: <paper_link> {Not published yet}

# Student grades
Using linear regression to predict student rades based on different studying parametrers

For model constructing this dataset was used: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance

Linear model shows better performance on this dataset. For detales see the same paper
